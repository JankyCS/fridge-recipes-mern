# Welcome to Fridge Recipes!
Fridge recipes is a modern day fridge-management, recipe-discovery tool to help users save money, minimize food waste, and get inspired in the kitchen. Try it out [here](https://fridgerecipes.herokuapp.com)!

This is actually the second version of the app, built with the **MERN** stack. This new version of the app was an opportunity to play around with **ReactJS**, while also brushing up on **Mongo, Node, and Express** [Check out the first version of the app here!](https://github.com/JankyCS/fridge-recipes)

## How To Use 
After registering and logging in on the website, users are prompted to a dashboard, where they can add items to their "fridge". These can be any food-items/ingredients found in the user's kitchen - they don't necessarily need to be refrigerated!

Then, a page of recipes is automatically returned to the user, based on the ingredients they already have.

The recipes are dynamically, and automatically generated as the user's fridge is updated, which helps to streamline the process.

## How It Works/Technologies Used
This project is built with the **MERN** stack. The frontend is built with **Bootstrap** and **ReactJS**. The **Express** server acts as a backend and uses **Mongoose** to model users for communicating with the **MongoDB database**. 

User passwords are secured/encrypted with **bcryptJS**, and authentication is facilitated with the **PassportJS** middleware, with the **Javascript Web Token** strategy.

The recipes are obtained with the [Recipe Puppy API](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/)
